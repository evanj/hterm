# Web Console

A web-based console server, using Chrome's [hterm](https://chromium.googlesource.com/apps/libapps/+/master/hterm) emulator to connect an arbitrary server-side program to a web page. [See my blog post for details and screenshots](http://www.evanjones.ca/terminal-in-the-browser.html).


## Running it locally

1. `go install github.com/evanj/hterm/cmd/htermmenu`
2. `$GOPATH/bin/htermmenu`
3. Go to http://localhost:8080/ and click on a choice


## Customizing it

htermmenu is an example of launching a shell with specific arguments. htermshell is just a bare-bones shell. Ideally you should just need to edit them to get something working.


## Rebuilding the Javascript dependencies

In the usual Go style, all the generated source code is checked in to the repository. If you want to edit the Javascript, run make in the root directory. This project was a bit of an experiment with some weird tools, so the Makefile is generated by the code in genmakefile, so you may need to run ./rebuild.sh if you want to upgrade the version of any of the dependencies.
